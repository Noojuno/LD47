  Text: Welcome to space, recruit!<page>I'm S.E.R.A.P.H, your AI assistant. My job
    is to guide you through the basics of looping!<page>You're currently standing
    on a <b>LOOP POINT</b>. Loop Points serve as the start point of your loops, and
    are where you'll end up when your loop timer runs out. You can change your loop
    point by activating a different one - but make sure to do so before the loop
    timer runs out otherwise you'll be sent back to your previous loop point.<page>You
    can view your loop timer in the top left of your suits integrated heads-up display.
    If you ever need to end your loop before the timer runs out, you can do so by
    pressing <b>Q</b>.<page>Your loop timer does not go down while you're standing
    on a Loop Point, so you can take your time after looping.<page>Proceed through
    the doors ahead when you're ready to continue.
