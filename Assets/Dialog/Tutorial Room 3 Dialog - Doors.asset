  Text: There are a few different types of doors on this station. The first is a
    <b>One-Way Door</b>, indicated by an arrow symbol on the door. These doors let
    you go through the door the direction the arrow is pointing, but not come back
    the other way.<page>The next type of door is a <b>Locking Door</b>. These doors
    have lock symbols on them, and will stay open when unpowered, as long as all
    power requirements have previously been met.<page>The final door type is the
    <b>Automatic Door</b>. This is the most simple type of door, and will just open
    when you are in close proximity. These doors have no special symbol, but will
    never have wires connected to it.<page>A door can be of multiple types a the
    same time, so make sure you pay attention to the icons on the door.
