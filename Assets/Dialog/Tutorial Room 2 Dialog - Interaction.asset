  Text: As you make your way through this station, you'll encounter doors that would
    normally require more than 1 person to open. Unfortunately, since it's just you,
    you'll have to make do with boxes. Luckily they seem to be all over the place
    - isn't that handy!<page>You can move boxes by either walking into them or by
    pressing <b>E</b> to pick them up. You can put them down again with <b>E</b>.<page>You
    can interact with many other things around the station, just look for the white
    tint!<page>Give it a go by moving some boxes so they are sitting on top of the
    red <b>buttons</b> on the floor so you can move through to the next section.
